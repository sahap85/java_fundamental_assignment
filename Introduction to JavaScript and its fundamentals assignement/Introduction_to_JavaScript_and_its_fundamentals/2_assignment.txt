Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

JavaScript and HTML are both essential components of web development, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

Purpose and Functionality:

HTML: 

 HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page.It is used to create static content and provides the
 basic layout of a webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements. HTML is primarily responsible for the structure and presentation
 of web content.
JavaScript: 

JavaScript is a programming language that enables dynamic and interactive behavior on a web page. It is used to add interactivity, 
responsiveness, and complex functionality to web applications. JavaScript can manipulate HTML elements, handle user events, and interact with 
web servers to create rich, dynamic web experiences.


Usage:

HTML: 

HTML is used to create the basic structure of a webpage. For example, you would use HTML to define headings,
 paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and other static content on a webpage. Here's an example of HTML code:

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
  </body>
</html>


JavaScript: JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive elements on a webpage. For example, you would use JavaScript to handle user
 input, validate form data, create animations, update content dynamically, and communicate with web servers.
 
 Here's an example of JavaScript code:

 function greetUser() {
  var userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");
  alert("Hello, " + userName + "!");
}
