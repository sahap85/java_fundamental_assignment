Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.


Comments in JavaScript serve several important purposes:

1. Documentation: Comments provide a way to document code, explaining its purpose, behavior, and any important details that might not be
 immediately apparent from the code itself. This helps other developers (and the original developer after some time has passed) understand 
 what the code is doing and why.

2. Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" sections of code for debugging purposes. This allows developers 
to isolate and identify issues without having to delete potentially important code.

3. Readability:-
Comments can make code more readable and understandable by breaking down complex logic into smaller, more manageable parts 
and providing explanations along the way.


Example of one line commenting

// This is a single-line comment. It is used to provide a short explanation or note about a specific line of code.
var x = 10; // This is a comment explaining the purpose of the variable x.


Example of multi line commenting

/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines and is useful for providing longer explanations
or for temporarily disabling multiple lines of code for debugging.
*/
var y = 20;
