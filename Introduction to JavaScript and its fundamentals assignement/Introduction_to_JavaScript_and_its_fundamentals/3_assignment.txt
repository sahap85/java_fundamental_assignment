Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.


In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types:

1.Boolean: Represents a logical value, true or false. It is commonly used in conditional statements and logical expressions.

2.Number: Represents numeric values, both integer and floating-point numbers. Numbers can be used for arithmetic operations and mathematical 
calculations.

3. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed within single or double quotes. Strings are used to store and manipulate textual data.

4.Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is the default value of uninitialized variables.

5.Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value. It is used to indicate that a variable has no value or does not refer to any object.
