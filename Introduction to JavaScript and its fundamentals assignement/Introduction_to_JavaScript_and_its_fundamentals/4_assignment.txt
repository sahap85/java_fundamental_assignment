What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve a memory location to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout 
the program. Variable declarations also allow developers to assign meaningful names to data, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Example:
let message = "Hello, world!";
let age = 30;
