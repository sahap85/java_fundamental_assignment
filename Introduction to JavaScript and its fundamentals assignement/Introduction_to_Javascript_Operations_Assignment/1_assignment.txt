Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?

Operators in JavaScript serve as symbols or words that perform operations on operands. 
They are essential in programming for several reasons:

1.Data Manipulation: Operators allow you to manipulate data by performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2.Comparison: Operators enable you to compare values, which is crucial for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program.

3.Assignment: Operators allow you to assign values to variables, which is fundamental for storing and managing data.

4.Logical Operations: Operators provide logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT, which are crucial for creating complex 
decision-making structures.

5.Control Flow: Operators are used to create control flow structures like loops and conditionals, which are essential for executing code
 in a structured manner.

6.String Manipulation: Operators also allow for string concatenation and other string manipulations, which are important for working with 
textual data.
