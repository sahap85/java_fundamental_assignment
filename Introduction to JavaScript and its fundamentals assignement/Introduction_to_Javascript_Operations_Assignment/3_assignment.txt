Question 3:Differentiate between unary, and binary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.


Unary operators operate on one operand, while binary operators operate on two operands.
Unary operators include the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators, the unary plus (+) and unary minus (-) operators, 
and the logical NOT (!) operator.

Binary operators include arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%),
 as well as assignment operators such as equals (=) and comparison operators such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>),
  less than (<), and so on.
