Describe the categorization of operators in  based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.

Operators in  can be categorized based on their functionality into several groups:

1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform arithmetic operations on numerical operands.

          Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
              var sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8
          
          Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
            var difference = 10 - 5; // difference is 5
          
          Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
            var product = 4 * 6; // product is 24

          Division (/): Divides one number by another.
            var quotient = 12 / 3; // quotient is 4

          Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
            var remainder = 12 % 5; // remainder is 2



2.Assignment Operators: These operators assign values to variables.

          Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
            var x = 5; // x is assigned the value 5

        Addition Assignment (+=): Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
                var x = 5;
              x += 3; // x is now 8

        Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
                        var x = 10;
              x -= 4; // x is now 6

         Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
              var x = 2;
              x *= 3; // x is now 6
          Division Assignment (/=): Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.

                var x = 12;
                x /= 3; // x is now 4


3.Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean result.

          Equal (==): Checks if two values are equal.

            var x = 5;
            var y = 5;
            var result = x == y; // result is true

Not Equal (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
          var x = 5;
          var y = 3;
          var result = x != y; // result is true
Strict Equal (===): Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.
          var x = 5;
          var y = "5";
          var result = x === y; // result is false
    Strict Not Equal (!==): Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.
          var x = 5;
          var y = "5";
          var result = x !== y; // result is true
Greater Than (>): Checks if one value is greater than another.
          var x = 10;
          var y = 5;
          var result = x > y; // result is true
Greater Than or Equal To (>=): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
          var x = 5;
          var y = 5;
          var result = x >= y; // result is true
Less Than (<): Checks if one value is less than another.
        var x = 3;
        var y = 5;
        var result = x < y; // result is true
Less Than or Equal To (<=): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.
        var x = 5;
        var y = 5;
        var result = x <= y; // result is true

4.Logical Operators: These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.

Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.    
        var x = true;
        var y = false;
        var result = x && y; // result is false

Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
        var x = true;
        var y = false;
        var result = x || y; // result is true

Logical NOT (!): Returns the opposite of the operand.
        var x = true;
        var result = !x; // result is false
